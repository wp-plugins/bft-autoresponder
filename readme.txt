== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I send unlimited messages? =

Yes, there is no limitation. However you'd better not set more than one email to be sent at the same number of days after user registration.

= Is there unsubscribe link? =

Yes, unsubscribe link is automatically added to every outgoing message.

= What to do if it doesn't send emails? = 

Please install a plugin like WP Mail SMTP or Easy WP SMTP and try to send a test email. If the test email isn't received, it means the problem is not in the autoresponder and you should talk to your hosting support.

= Are there any limitsto how many emails can be sent? = 

The autoresponder itself does not impose any limits, but your hosting company probably does. If you plan to have large mailing list, you will need the pro version because it lets you fine-tune the number of emails sent to comply with your hosting company limitations.
